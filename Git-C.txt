basicaly technical name for a project in git is a repository.
so we go ahead and create  git repository in order to start our project.
CREATE
-git init(initializes the folder as a git repository)

once we create the repo git then keeps the check for the changes in that folder/files.

-ls -la(shows al the files inside the folder including hidden ones)

COMMIT
-git add .(basically we are telling git to add the changes we made to our project)
In order for git to keep track of the changes to our project we need to commit these changes
whenever we are making a commit...its like we are telling git to save this instance....more like taking a snapshot:)


-git commit -m "(just a message)"
we can come back to this in later time

-git log(shows all the commits)
-git log --author=""(from specific author)
